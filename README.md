<h1>Tesla Clone Site</h1>

This is my first mini project. Currently done the Bootstrap section in Colt Steele Web Developer Course. I attempted recreating Tesla Official website. Didn't include JS, because I still didn't get to the part with Java Script on the course. <b>THIS IS ONLY FOR MY PRACTICE!</b> This whole file will be deleted in few days. Place take a look at my code.
